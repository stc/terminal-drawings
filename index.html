          Terminal Drawings are a collection of machine drawn images that involve text based simulations to represent
          associative space. As the computer terminal is a low-level ontological tool for interfacing the real world
          with computational landscapes, these series resemble the performative mechanics of such gateways.

          Given that digital information doesn't inherently exist in physical space, we can use any structure to
          illustrate relationships between files, folders, thoughts and other conceptual entities.

          Artificial memory architectures often grapple with the dichotomy between associative and spatial memory
          paradigms. While spatial memory frameworks prioritize the organization of information in physical or abstract
          spatial arrangements, reflecting the human brain's propensity for spatial cognition, associative memory models
          prioritize the interconnectedness of information, emphasizing the strength of relationships between data
          points.

          Although the drawings are based on text-based characters and operator symbols from low-level computer code,
          their structures escape verbal determinations and function as an absorption surface for conventional formulae.
          Without relying on language, form becomes the defining element— a gesture that shapes hybrid ontologies of
          existential space.

          All pieces are created with custom code, executed in a command-line interface and available as unique editions of hand signed physical
          plotter drawings + corresponding NFTs on Ethereum (Base). The NFT (Certificate of Authenticity) acts as
          provenance for the physical piece shipped, any secondary sale of a work must include the physical.
